Spring

Inversion of Control (IoC) - methodology/pattern giving control of code to framework
			- allowing out beans to be managed and have dependencies provided to them
(Framework)

Counter*** to service-locator pattern - library structure, beans manage own lifecycle, control location and instantiation of dependencies
library - list of functions and resources

Hollywood Principle (of IoC) - "Don't call us, we'll call you"

Dependency Injection - way to achieve IoC
dependency - resource to be used
injection - act of passing a dependency to the dependent object

decoupling task execution from task implementation
more modularity, less boilerplate

Spring framework -> Java framework (2002, rob johnson) used by pretty much everyone, to make D.J. easy for developers

Spring container / IoC container manages/stores app's dependencies

java object which contains information about mappings and instances of dependencies

injects dependencies of registered beans


POJOs (beans)	-> IoC Container	-> Working app
