HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol
TCP: transmission control protocoal

send requests to uri/url - universal resource identifier/locator

include verb or method indicating the type of request

get - for obtaining the resource of that url

html - hypertext markup language

standard markup language for structuring web pages

grandparent - xml

elements are represented by tags

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head> <- meta information
    <title>HelloWorld</title>
  </head>
  <body> <- what actually renders
    <div>
      <h1>THIS IS A HEADING</h1> <- headings h1-h6
    </div>
	<p>This is text in a paragraph.</p>
	<a href="some link">This is a link</a>
	<img src = "cats.jpg" alt="this is cats"/>
  </body>
</html>

File paths: 
Two types:
  absolute - fine for includeing url to resource, depends on host and location
  relatives - preferred for local resources relative to the current file
<img src = "cats.jpg"/> is in same folder
<img src = "images/cats.jpg"/> is in images folder, which is in current folder
<img src = "/images/cats.jpg"/> images is in root of current folder
<img src = "../cats.jpg /> cats is in super folder

CSS - cascading style sheets
describes how HTML elements will be displayed

Describes how html elements be displayed - color, font, width/height, alignment, etc.

Can standardize accross multiple pages

Three ways to add styling:
1. inline - use style attribute
2. internal - use <style></style> element in head
3. external - including separate css file

1. inline - <h1 style="background-color:blue">Hello</h1>
2. internal - <head><style>h1 {background-color:blue}</style></head>
3. external - <head><link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" /></head> styles.css like what's in style block in internal

styling "cascades" into a "virtual stylesheet" which takes into account ALL styling applied to a particular element
Predecence - highest -> lowest (inline, internal or external (have same precedence so applied in literal order on the page), browser default)

h1 { background-color: blue; font-size: 12px }
^ Selector	^ Declaration

3 Types - 1. element (with that name), 2. class - applies rule to elements of specified class ".myClass", 3. id - applies rule to element with unique id "#myId"


<h1 class="myclass" id="someId">Hello</h1>
		^	^	attributes
