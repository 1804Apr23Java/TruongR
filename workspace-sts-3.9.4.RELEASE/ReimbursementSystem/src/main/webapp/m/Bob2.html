Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Just make little strokes like that. This piece of canvas is your world.

A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important.

There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. There it is. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint.

This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. Let your imagination be your guide. Trees grow however makes them happy.

You're meant to have fun in life. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.

The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.

A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. And just raise cain.

I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it.

A happy cloud. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Let's get wild today. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first.

Those great big fluffy clouds. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be.

Let's make a nice big leafy tree. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it.

If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it.

This is your world. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Maybe there's a little something happening right here.

It's cold, but it's beautiful. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here.

Just make a decision and let it go. In your world you can create anything you desire. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path.

There comes a nice little fluffer. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart.

I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. You can do it. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better.

I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend.

Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Be brave. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Don't fight it, use what happens. We have a fantastic little sky! Here's something that's fun.

Isn't that fantastic? Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts.

Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world.

This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. There are no limits in this world. Let's have a little bit of fun today. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it.

If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be.

I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. Son of a gun. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy.

We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. The least little bit can do so much. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart.

That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. Happy painting, God bless. I like to beat the brush.

Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Let your heart be your guide. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things.

Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it.

Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. Let the paint work. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them.

Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. See there, told you that would be easy. Learn when to stop.

Clouds are free they come and go as they please. This painting comes right out of your heart. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow.

A big strong tree needs big strong roots. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. You can do anything your heart can imagine. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special.

The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Use what you see, don't plan it. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it.

Fluff that up. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here.

You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it.

In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Imagination is the key to painting.

Let's have a happy little tree in here. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there.

We don't have anything but happy trees here. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. You can get away with a lot.

Get tough with it, get strong. It is a lot of fun. Anyone can paint. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. Don't fiddle with it all day.

Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Let's have a nice tree right here. Here we're limited by the time we have. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that.

Let's build an almighty mountain. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. In your world you have total and absolute power. We'll do another happy little painting. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there.

Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Let's do that again. Let's build some happy little clouds up here.

Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead.

This is the way you take out your flustrations. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. What the devil. There we go.

Let your imagination be your guide. This is unplanned it really just happens. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Use your imagination, let it go.

Let's do it again then, what the heck. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. It looks so good, I might as well not stop.

There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. In this world, everything can be happy. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends.

Working it up and down, back and forth. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out.

There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. Just beat the devil out of it. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. You can create anything that makes you happy. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here.

Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. Only eight colors that you need. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it.

You can spend all day playing with mountains. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. This is gonna be a happy little seascape.

We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. We'll make some happy little bushes here. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death.

A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue We'll play with clouds today. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds.

In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. Do an almighty painting with us. Let that brush dance around there and play.

Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. I thought today we would do a happy little picture.

You are only limited by your imagination. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. This is truly an almighty mountain. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world.

Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. It's important to me that you're happy. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart.

You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. A little happy sunlight shining through there. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun

Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Brown is such a nice color. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Every day I learn.

How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Just use the old one inch brush. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall.

We can fix anything. We'll have a super time. Don't be bashful drop me a line. The light is your friend. Preserve it.

Put it in, leave it alone. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it.

I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Let's get crazy. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow.

I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Work that paint. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator.

Have fun with it. Poor old tree. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. That's crazy.

Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Trees cover up a multitude of sins.

The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it.

You gotta think like a tree. We need dark in order to show light. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow.

See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Very easy to work these to death. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Every time you practice, you learn more. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. You have to make these big decisions.

See there how easy that is. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Anything you want to do you can do here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown.

Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. This is the fun part You need the dark in order to show the light. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day.

We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet.

At home you have unlimited time. Everybody needs a friend. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain.

All kinds of happy little splashes. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. Let all these things just sort of happen.

I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Take your time. Speed will come later. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy.

Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. And right there you got an almighty cloud. You have to make those little noises or it won't work.

Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. A beautiful little sunset. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper.

In life you need colors. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow.

You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself.

Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer.

Now then, let's play. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. With practice comes confidence. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Just make little strokes like that.

This piece of canvas is your world. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here.

You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. There it is. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild.

A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. Let your imagination be your guide.

Trees grow however makes them happy. You're meant to have fun in life. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder.

Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.

Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Be brave. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens.
